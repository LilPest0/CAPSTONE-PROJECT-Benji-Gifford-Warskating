# Warskating: Capstone Project

This is a research project focusing on building a wardriving system and applying it to real-world network planning, security analysis and enforcement.

This page consists of any code I created in the development process. Please see my [wiki](https://github.com/LilPest0/CAPSTONE-PROJECT-Benji-Gifford-Warskating/wiki) for a more detailed documentation!
