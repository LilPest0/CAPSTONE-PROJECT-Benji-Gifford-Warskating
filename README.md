The proposed project seeks to create a sophisticated urban Wi-Fi network mapping system with the objective of producing an interactive map for practical use. This innovative system will utilize skateboards equipped with network scanning technology to comprehensively survey Wi-Fi networks throughout urban areas. The collected data will be consolidated and presented through an interactive map interface, enabling users to locate Wi-Fi networks and gain insights into city-wide data activity , among other features.

In today’s interconnected world, access to Wi-Fi networks is essential for communication, work, and leisure. “WiFi is a key communication tool, allowing all parties involved to move toward a richer, more engaging, more connected future” (The SmartCity Journal). However, existing Wi-Fi network maps often lack accuracy, real-time updates, and the ability to visualize city-wide data activity. Traditional wardriving methods using vehicles are often too fast to capture all networks effectively, and they rarely provide a means for public access to this valuable information.

The primary purpose of this project is to address these limitations by creating a comprehensive and interactive map that serves as a valuable resource for residents, visitors, and urban planners. My project aims to:

Accurately Map Wi-Fi Networks: By employing specially designed network scanning technology, I can collect data with a finer degree of precision. A skateboard’s slower pace enables the system to scan for networks with greater efficiency and detail, while remaining more discreet than a car. One researcher, Alex Lynd, has tested this theory. “...he’s able to go largely unnoticed while riding his skateboard in areas that would be inaccessible to an unauthorized automobile” (Cook).

Create an Interactive Map: The centerpiece of this project is the development of an interactive map allowing users to locate available Wi-Fi networks and visualize data activity in different areas of the city. Knowing where to find free WiFi would be a great asset to the citizens of Burlington. “WiFi is a key communication tool, allowing all parties involved to move toward a richer, more engaging, more connected future” (The SmartCity Journal).

Enhance Public Connectivity: By providing access to a detailed and up-to-date Wi-Fi network map, this project could improve public connectivity and help individuals make informed decisions about network usage, whether for work, leisure, or security-related situations. "Cities can take their WiFi analytics and improve these users’ lives faster than ever before: increasing the number of buses, fixing damages in urban elements like lighting, and generally creating more efficient processes to handle emergency situations" (The SmartCity Journal).

Support Urban Planning: The data collected will be valuable for urban planners and local businesses, aiding in decisions related to network infrastructure and digital inclusion initiatives. "Smart city leaders must drive engagement and monetize WiFi throughout residents and visitors’ entire urban experiences" (The SmartCity Journal).

Use wardriving to detect stalkers: Along with mapping WiFi nodes, the device that I’m building will show IoT patterns, indicating if another device is following the user. This is another concept proven by MIT’s Alex Lynd. “What can you learn from the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals coming from smartphones and other wireless devices? … [this project] uses wardriving data to find when a wireless device is following him” (Kinzie).

The project will involve Wi-Fi scanning technology and the development of a sophisticated data processing and visualization platform. I will deploy the device as I traverse Burlington, collecting Wi-Fi network data. This data will then be consolidated, analyzed, and integrated into an interactive map accessible via web and mobile applications.
